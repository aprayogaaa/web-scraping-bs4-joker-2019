# Limitations
The data for scraping comes from metacritic website (https://www.metacritic.com/movie/joker/user-reviews). But, there are limitiations such as:

* Phrase like "Click to Expand" that shouldn't be in the review table. The word refers to a button that shouldn't be reviewed.

* In relation to the first point, while web scraping, there should be a total of 7485 data but only 2786 are actually obtained. This may mean that some reviews are not all collected. This refers to the process of iterations.


If there is someone who can help me regarding this limitation, especially on the first point. Feel free to contact me at: gameranak16@gmail.com
